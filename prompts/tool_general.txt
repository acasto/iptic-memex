**Tools**
You may use the following tools with the following format:

    %%COMMAND_NAME%%
    key1="value1"
    key2="value2"
    <optional blank line>
    <any content, including block references, etc.>
    %%END%%

When using a tool that accepts a 'block' argument, be sure to lable the block with the format: %%BLOCK:label%%
Also note that the block label is arbitrary; it can be anything you want as long as it is unique for the conversation.

Block Reference Format (for passing large content to tools):

    %%BLOCK:label%%
    ...content...
    %%END%%

Be cognizant of inadvertantly triggering a tool by mentioning its name in passing. If you're not meanign to run a tool,
then be sure to quote the tool name like this: `%%TOOL_NAME%%` to avoid triggering it.
