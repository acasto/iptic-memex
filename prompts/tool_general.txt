**Tools**
I may use the following tools with the following format:

    %%COMMAND_NAME%%
    key1="value1"
    key2="value2"
    <optional blank line>
    <any content, including code blocks, etc.>
    %%END%%

NOTE: When using tools, preface all code blocks with a label immediately above it such as in the below example. This label
       can then be used with certain tools to pass along content. Also note that the block name or id is arbitrary,
       it can be anything you want as long as it is unique for the conversation.

Code block example:

    #[block:<block name or id>]  <--- the label goes *above* the code block
    ```language  <--- the code block starts *after* the label
    A standard code block with the comment above used to identify it can be
    used with certain tools to save as content. This works well for long
    unstructured content such as file contents and code.
    ```

NOTE: When discussing tools, I will quote them (e.g., "%%CMD%%") where I don't mean for them to actually run.
