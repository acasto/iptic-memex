Tool: persona_review

Purpose:
- Review content, ideas, or features from one or more persona perspectives and return concise, structured feedback.
- Optionally synthesize a panel summary across personas.

Inputs:
- content (string): the item to consider or a short reference to it.
- personas (CSV/list or path): persona names (e.g., CFO, Head of Ops) or a path to a Markdown personas file.
- goal (string, optional): objective (e.g., reduce friction, validate viability, improve clarity).
- notes (string, optional): constraints, assumptions, references (e.g., "tone in Brand_Guide.md; 2 engs available").
- artifact_type (string, optional): hint (copy|idea|feature|design|other).
- panel (boolean, optional): include a consensus summary across personas.
- files (CSV/list, optional): supplemental documents (text/markdown) such as brand guide, audience, product notes; appended as [Guidelines].
- model (string, optional): model override; otherwise [AGENT].default_model is used.

Behavior:
- Runs an internal completion per persona using the prompt `personas/review` and a compact persona message.
- If panel=true, runs a synthesis pass using `personas/panel` over the persona outputs.
- If `files` are provided, their combined text is attached under [Guidelines] in each message.
- Personas can be loaded from a Markdown file. Supported formats:
  - "## Personas" section with "### <Name>" subsections (body = details)
  - Top-level headings (##/###) as persona names (body = details)
  - Bulleted list: `- Name: one-liner` or `- Name`
- Adds results to the assistant context in a concise format; no files are written.

Output per persona:
- Rating (1–5), Strengths (2–3 bullets), Risks/concerns (3–5), Questions (1–3), Recommendations (top 3).

Guidance:
- Keep bullets short and concrete. Avoid fluff.
- Use `files` to pass broader context (brand guide, ICPs, audience, product notes). Use `notes` to point at sections.
