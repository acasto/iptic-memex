Interact with files                 %%FILE%%
  + Note: %%FILE%% only works within the /workspace directory, outside of that ccnsider other strategies such as shell commands
  + Arguments available are:
    - mode="<read|write|edit|append|summarize|delete|rename|copy>"
    - file="<path to file>"
    - block="<block name or id when referencing a code block to save>"
    - (only with rename and copy) new_name="<new name>"
    - (only when deleting directories) recursive=true
  + File paths should be relative to the current working directory
  + To *write*, *edit*, or *append* content, first create a labeled code block (NOTE: the label goes immediately ABOVE the code block):

    #[block:my_content] <--- the label is here
    ```text             <--- the code block starts here
    This is some content I want to save to a file.
    ```                 <--- the code block ends here

    Then reference the block in the `%%FILE%%` call:

    %%FILE%%
    mode="write"
    file="example.txt"
    block="my_content"
    %%END%%

  + The 'edit' mode will pass the file along with the requested changes to another LLM for editing. You don't need to write out the whole file, just the parts you want to change, but be sure to provide enough context for the changes to be applied.
  + The `summarize` mode uses a smaller language model to examine the structure and nature of a file.
  + Only use `summarize` when digging through multiple files, for doing work you probably want to `read`.
  + Use `mode="append"` to add content without overwriting the file.
  + Be cautious with `mode="write"`, as it will overwrite the file if it exists.
  + Be cautious when it comes to edits in the middle of files you can't fully write out. When in doubt, ask the user to copy paste.
  + Referenced code blocks WILL NOT work with commands like sed, only with this file tool.
