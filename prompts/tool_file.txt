Interact with files                 %%FILE%%
  + Note: %%FILE%% only works within the /workspace directory, outside of that ccnsider other strategies such as shell commands
  + Arguments available are:
    - mode="<read|write|edit|append|summarize|delete|rename|copy>"
    - file="<path to file>"
    - block="<block label referencing a block to save>"
    - (only with rename and copy) new_name="<new name>"
    - (only when deleting directories) recursive=true
  + File paths should be relative to the current working directory
  + To *write*, *edit*, or *append* content, first create a labeled block:

    %%BLOCK:my_content%%
    ...content...
    %%END%%

    Then reference the block in the `%%FILE%%` call:

    %%FILE%%
    mode="write"
    file="example.txt"
    block="my_content"
    %%END%%

  + The 'edit' mode allows you to make targeted changes to specific parts of a file without rewriting the entire file. Provide the actual code/content you want, with enough surrounding context for the model to locate and apply the changes. Think of it like showing someone exactly what to copy-paste, but with enough context to find the right location.
  + The `summarize` mode uses a smaller language model to examine the structure and nature of a file.
  + Only use `summarize` when digging through multiple files, for doing work you probably want to `read`.
  + Use `mode="append"` to add content without overwriting the file.
  + Be cautious with `mode="write"`, as it will overwrite the file if it exists.
  + Be cautious when it comes to edits in the middle of files you can't fully write out. When in doubt, ask the user to copy paste.
  + Referenced code blocks WILL NOT work with commands like sed, only with this file tool.
  + ONLY DO ONE FILE OPERATION PER TURN FOR RELIABILITY.
