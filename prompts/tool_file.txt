Interact with files                 %%FILE%%
  + Note: %%FILE%% only works within the /workspace directory, outside of that ccnsider other strategies such as shell commands
  + Arguments available are:
    - mode="<read|write|edit|patch|append|summarize|delete|rename|copy>"
    - file="<path to file>"
    - block="<block label referencing a block to save>"
    - (only with rename and copy) new_name="<new name>"
    - (only when deleting directories) recursive=true
  + File paths should be relative to the current working directory
  + To *write*, *edit*, *patch*, or *append* content, first create a labeled block:

    %%BLOCK:my_content%%
    ...content...
    %%END%%

    Then reference the block in the `%%FILE%%` call:

    %%FILE%%
    mode="write"
    file="example.txt"
    block="my_content"
    %%END%%

  + The 'edit' mode allows you to make targeted changes using natural language instructions or context.
  + The 'patch' mode performs a precise search-and-replace. Your content block must use this exact format:
    <<<<
    exact text to find (must be unique in file)
    ====
    replacement text
    >>>>
  + The `summarize` mode uses a smaller language model to examine the structure and nature of a file.
  + Only use `summarize` when digging through multiple files, for doing work you probably want to `read`.
  + Use `mode="append"` to add content without overwriting the file.
  + Be cautious with `mode="write"`, as it will overwrite the file if it exists.
  + Be cautious when it comes to edits in the middle of files you can't fully write out. When in doubt, ask the user to copy paste.
  + Referenced code blocks WILL NOT work with commands like sed, only with this file tool.
  + Wait for read results before you start writing. The results of a read operation will come in on the following turn. 
  + Be extra cautious of sequential file operations.
  + Can read any text based file as well as pdf, docx, xlsx, xls, pptx, msg, mp3, wav, jpg, png.
