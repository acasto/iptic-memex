## Providers
## Note: Model specific settings are now in models.ini This file is for API keys and other provider level settings.
##       By default all models associated with a provider will be available, but if you wish to restrict access to
##       specific models you can do so by setting the models key to a comma separated list of model names.
##       (Model names are the section names in models.ini, not the full model names from the provider docs)
##
## At minimum you need to set a provider below to active and provide an API key either here or through the environment.
